**Simon:** MixedDrink class,  A simple mixed drink consisting of two liquids e.g. a *Gin Tonic*. 
**Dominik** SoftDrink class, consisting of Soft drinks 

-First added some mebervariables to the superclass Drinks.

-Added additional method to the class SoftDrink, mixSoftDrink().

-Reworked the constructor SoftDrink(), now he is initializing the supervarialbles a value and the i changed the arguments passed from a scanner to a fixed value.

-Added SoftDrinkTest.java to test the SoftDrink.java class,
all methods had given the expected value exclusevly the mixSoftDrink() method.
here I had to delete the first an last spaces in order to guarantee the same return value in comparison to the expected value.

-Deleted the scanner. Was not necessary not used.


**Katarina** Wine class, a class with different wines
